Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have tried to find "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have used correlation with the on-off time-course;
  * we will try a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * then, detection of activation by multiple regression.

* The Python module search path::

    import sys
    sys.path.append('/path/containing/modules')

* Exercise |--| using ``pearson.py`` and array reshaping:
  :doc:`faster_correlation`;
* A better regressor using convolution |--| :doc:`convolution_background`;
* Introduction to linear models |--| :doc:`model_one_voxel`;
* Exercise |--| :doc:`multi_voxel`.
